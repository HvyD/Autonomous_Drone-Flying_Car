Starter Code:
This was orignally from Udacity FCND-starter course kit....

Packages used:

* [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [`jupyter`](http://jupyter.org/)
* [`future`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future)
* [`lxml`](http://lxml.de/)
* [`pymavlink`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymavlink). Common [MAVLink messages](http://mavlink.org/messages/common/). We recommend glancing over these to get a feel for the type of messages send back and forth.

NOTE: `future` and `lxml` are required by `pymavlink`, and if they are not installed prior to `pymavlink` this may cause issues.

NOTE: If you're on MacOS you'll need to install developer tools to install `pymavlink`. You can do this by typing the following into a shell:

```
xcode-select --install
```
